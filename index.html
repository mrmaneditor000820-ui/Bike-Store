    <h2>EV BIKES.</h2>
    <p><h3>
**Electric Vehicles (EV) Bikes** represent a transformative step in modern urban mobility, combining technological innovation with environmental sustainability. Powered by rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, EV bikes eliminate dependency on fossil fuels, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. They offer lower operating costs compared to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) bikes, since electricity is cheaper than petrol and maintenance requirements are minimal due to fewer moving parts. Moreover, advancements in battery technology are leading to extended range, faster charging, and improved performance, making EV bikes increasingly practical for both short city commutes and longer rides. With governments worldwide providing incentives, expanding charging infrastructure, and promoting clean mobility, EV bikes are rapidly emerging as a crucial component of the sustainable transportation ecosystem and a vital solution for reducing the carbon footprint of the automotive sector.</h3></p>
